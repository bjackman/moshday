Synchrotron is a tool for syncing a directory with a USB device. It is currently
unfinished, most work having been done at a single hack-day. 

Contact Brendan Jackman at jackmab1-remove_this_antispam_bit@cs.man.ac.uk with
any enquiries.

this program depends on pyudev, lxml and pyinotify

udevadm can be useful for debgging (name may differ between distros)

if this program does not react to a device, use udevadm to check whether your device is being 
assigned a UUID.
In testing this was found to be a problem for one device. This is under
investigation, but it appears to be due to cheap and old devices improperly
implementing the USB mass storage device class.

this program may require newer versions of pyudev (tested with version 16).
TODO: NOTE ALL VERSION OF LIBRARIES USED!
